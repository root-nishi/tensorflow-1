    "This solution presents an accessible, non-trivial example of machine learning with financial time series on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series are an essential part of financial analysis. Today, you have more data at your disposal than ever, more sources of data, and more frequent delivery of that data. New sources include new exchanges, social media outlets, and news sources. The frequency of delivery has increased from tens of messages per second 10 years ago, to hundreds of thousands of messages per second today. Naturally, more and different analysis techniques are being brought to bear as a result. Most of the modern analysis techniques aren't different in the sense of being new, and they all have their basis in statistics, but their applicability has closely followed the amount of computing power available. The growth in available computing power is faster than the growth in time series volumes, so it is possible to analyze time series today at scale in ways that weren't previously practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, machine learning techniques, especially deep learning, hold great promise for time series analysis. As time series become more dense and many time series overlap, machine learning offers a way to separate the signal from the noise, even when the noise can seem overwhelming. Deep learning holds great potential because it is often the best fit for the seemingly random nature of financial time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this solution, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Obtain data for a number of financial markets.\n",
    "* Munge that data into a usable format and perform exploratory data analysis in order to explore and validate a premise.\n",
    "* Use TensorFlow to build, train and evaluate a number of models for predicting what will happen in financial markets\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll perform the entire investigation in this Cloud Datalab notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** This solution is intended to illustrate the capabilities of GCP and TensorFlow for fast, interactive, iterative data analysis and machine learning. It does not offer any advice on financial markets or trading strategies. The scenario presented in the tutorial is an example. Don't use this code to make investment decisions."

    "The premise is straightforward: financial markets are increasingly global, and if you follow the sun from Asia to Europe to the US and so on, you can use information from an earlier time zone to your advantage in a later time zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table shows a number of stock market indices from around the globe, their closing times in Eastern Standard Time (EST), and the delay in hours between the close that index and the close of the S&P 500 in New York. This makes EST the base time zone. For example, Australian markets close for the day 15 hours before US markets close. If the close of the All Ords in Australia is a useful predictor of the close of the S&P 500 for a given day we can use that information to guide our trading activity. Continuing our example of the Australian All Ords, if this index closes up and we think that means the S&P 500 will close up as well then we should either buy stocks that compose the S&P 500 or, more likely, an ETF that tracks the S&P 500. In reality, the situation is more complex because there are commissions and tax to account for. But as a first approximation, we'll assume an index closing up indicates a gain, and vice-versa.\n",

    "You've covered a lot of ground. You moved from sourcing five years of financial time-series data, to munging that data into a more suitable form. You explored and visualized that data with exploratory data analysis and then decided on a machine learning model and the features for that model. You engineered those features, built a binary classifier in TensorFlow, and analyzed its performance. You built a feed forward neural net with two hidden layers in TensorFlow and analyzed its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "How did the technology fare? It should take most people 1.5 to 3 hours to extract the juice from this solution, and none of that time is spent waiting for infrastructure or software; it's spent reading and thinking. In many organizations, it can take anywhere from days to months to do this sort of data analysis, depending on whether you need to procure any hardware. And you didn't need to do anything with infrastructure or additional software. Rather, you used a web-based console to direct GCP to set up systems on your behalf, which it did—fully managed, maintained, and supported—freeing you up to spend your time analyzing. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was also cost effective. If you took your time with this solution and spent three hours to go through it, the cost would be a few pennies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Datalab worked admirably, too. iPython/Jupyter has always been a great platform for interactive, iterative work and a fully-managed version of that platform on GCP, with connectors to other GCP technologies such as BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage, is a force multiplier for your analysis needs.  If you haven't used iPython before, this solution might have been eye opening, for you. If you're already familiar with iPython, then you'll love the connectors to other GCP technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, R and Matlab are popular tools in machine learning, and we've made no mention either in this solution. Neither R nor Matlab are available as managed services on GCP. Both can be hosted in GCP and accessed through a cloud-friendly, web frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is a special piece of technology. It is expressive, performs well, and comes with the weight of Google's machine learning history and expertise to back it up and support it. We've only scratched the surface, but you can already see that within a handful of lines of code we've been able to write two models. Neither of them is cutting edge, by design, but neither of them is trivial either. With some additional tuning they would suit a whole spectrum of machine learning tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, how did we do with the data analysis? We did well: over 70% accuracy in predicting the close of the S&P 500 is the highest we've seen achieved on this dataset, so with few steps and a few lines of code we've produced a full-on machine learning model. The reason for the relatively modest accuracy achieved is the dataset itself; there isn't enough signal there to do significantly better. But 7 times out of 10, we were able to correctly determine if the S&P 500 index would close up or down on the day, and that's objectively good."
